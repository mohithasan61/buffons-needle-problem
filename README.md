# Buffon's Needle Problem

Welcome to the repository! This repository contains Python code to simulate and explore Buffon's Needle Problem, a classic problem in geometric probability.

## What is Buffon's Needle Problem?
Buffon's Needle Problem is a famous question in probability theory posed by the French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. The problem involves dropping a needle of a certain length onto a lined surface and determining the probability that the needle will intersect one of the lines.
